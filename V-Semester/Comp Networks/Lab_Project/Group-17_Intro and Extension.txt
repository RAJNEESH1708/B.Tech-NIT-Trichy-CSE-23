Title : A Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol for Device Management in Space-ground Integrated Network 


Introduction : 

        The existing reliable multicast transport protocols tend to maintain
        a stable structure during the full lifecycle, which sharply reduces the efficiency
        and is not suitable for device management in satellite network.

        In this paper, we design a reliable multicast transport protocol for device management,
        which contains 2 key ideas: 

            1) In the aspect of acknowledgement aggregation, we design a rapidly 
               tree-organized scheme for a temporary structure in each transmission,
               to reduce the time cost in dynamic multicast group forming. 

            2) In the aspect of local error recovery, we present an evaluation 
               scheme in the quality of communication, to choose a less-energy-cost way
               between local multicast and local broadcast to relay.

Extension : 

        Future works will be focused on the optimization in the located and the election of the proxy node,
        to increase the universality. 
        Also to Design the Efficient Brodcasting Algorithm, when the model demands broadcast over multicast.
        Similar Ideas in the field of Vehicular Ad Hoc Network can be explored.
